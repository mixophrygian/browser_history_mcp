    Then provide:

    1. **Browsers Available**
       - List the browsers that you were able to retrieve history from.

    2. **Time Distribution Analysis**
       - Calculate percentage of time on work-related vs entertainment sites
       - Identify peak productivity hours based on work-site visits
       - Show time spent per domain/category
    
    3. **Session Pattern Recognition**
       - Group visits into sessions (max 2-hour gaps between visits)
       - Identify "rabbit hole" sessions (many related searches in sequence)
       - Flag sessions that started productive but drifted
    
   4. **Focus Metrics**
       - Average session duration on productive sites
       - Number of context switches between work and entertainment
       - Longest uninterrupted work sessions
    
   5. **Actionable Recommendations**
       - Top 3 time-sink websites to consider blocking
       - Optimal work hours based on historical patterns
       - Specific habits to change (e.g., "You check Reddit 15x/day on average")
    
    Present findings in a clear format with specific numbers and time periods.
